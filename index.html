        <h2>About Bicol</h2>
        <p>The Bicol Region, located in the southeastern part of the island of Luzon, Philippines, is a vibrant and diverse area known for its stunning natural landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and agricultural economy. Comprising six provinces—<strong>Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Masbate, and Sorsogon</strong>—the region is bordered by the Philippine Sea to the east, the Bicol Gulf to the south, and the Samar Sea to the west. Legazpi City serves as the regional center, while Naga City is an important religious and cultural hub.</p>
        <p>Bicol is renowned for its striking geography, which includes Mayon Volcano, famous for its near-perfect cone shape, as well as lush mountains, pristine beaches, and islands. The region’s natural beauty draws tourists, and its economy is heavily based on agriculture, with coconuts, rice, corn, and fisheries being key industries. The region is also known for its spicy cuisine, such as Bicol Express (a dish made with pork and chili peppers) and Laing (taro leaves cooked in coconut milk).</p>
        <p>The history of Bicol is shaped by early resistance to Spanish colonization, followed by integration into the colonial system. During Spanish rule, the region became an important center for Christianity, with Naga City hosting the venerated Our Lady of Peñafrancia. Bicol has experienced multiple natural disasters over the centuries, including eruptions from the active Mayon Volcano and numerous typhoons. Despite these challenges, Bicol has developed strong regional identities, with different provinces speaking distinct dialects of Bicolano.</p>
        <p>Today, Bicol is thriving. Its economy is heavily rooted in agriculture, with coconuts, rice, corn, and fisheries as its main industries. Tourism is also flourishing, driven by the region’s unique mix of natural wonders, rich history, and welcoming people. Visitors often leave Bicol enchanted, <strong>but no trip is complete without bringing home its famous pasalubong</strong>. From the addictive Pili Nuts to chili-infused treats and handcrafted delicacies, Bicol’s pasalubong captures the essence of its vibrant culture and flavors, allowing you to take a piece of this remarkable region home.</p>
