                <h3>Sili Beer</h3>
                <p>The Bicol region is well-known for its spicy food and heavy use of sili in many local dishes.

The unique beer is also served on tap in the bar along with other local brews like a chocolate stout flavored with Bicol Cacao and coffee beans.</p>

               <h3>Camarines Sur's signature noodles</h3>
 <p>If you have not tried pancit bato, a noodle dish prepared like pancit canton but with special noodles that are a tad thicker and firmer, then your Bicol experience is incomplete. Pancit Bato got its name from the municipality of Bato in Camarines Sur, where the noodles originated. Usually served with hot pandesal, this noodle dish has been a breakfast and merienda staple for Bicolanos since time immemorial. </p> 
<p>If you want to recreate this taste at home, head to the local markets or stop by Declaro's Original Pancit Bato Factory located along the national highway in San Miguel village in Bato town for more noodle choices.</p>
