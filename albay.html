                <h3>Pili Nuts Candy</h3>
                <p> For local dessert, look no further! Head on to Legazpi City, Albay. The town is also known for its native premium pili nuts. There, you can experience the unique taste of Philippine nuts.
                
                Pili Nut is an indigenous nut that grows primarily in the Bicol region. It can be eaten raw, roasted, or caramelized (Pili Nut candy).
                
                One of the most trusted stores that offer the best pili nut candies and other products made of Pili is the Albay Pilinut Candy, located in Legazpi City. There are many variants of pili candies that you can choose from. Mazapan De Pili, Caramelitos, Salted Pili, Butternuts, Pastillas, and Sesame seed coated pili nuts are best-sellers.
                Prices are very affordable here; that’s why visitors would always include their pili nut shopping in their itinerary to bring home to friends and family after their trip.</p>

                <h3>Banig</h3>
                <p> Near Legazpi is a town called Bacacay, where generations of weavers continue the tradition of making banig. Prices start from just 200 pesos. It’s tempting to haggle, but I suggest not to do it as these take hours to finish and are really considered a labor of love.</p>

                <h3>Ligao's Rice Puto</h3><p> Road trips going to Albay are never complete without stoping by at Ligao for their famous Rice Puto. It’s a mixture of pounded and glutinous rice, filled with locally made macapuno, placed in coconut husks and cooked over wood fire. You should eat it right away while its hot; it’s always a great snack when you’re on the road.</p>
